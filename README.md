# Assembler assignment

The assignmet is creating assembler program to an imaginary computer (for exemple 14-bit memory word length).
The program input is assembly files, and it's output is "encrypted" 14-bits memory image in case of success (and some more file for a linker), or print (to stdout) assembly errors.

The assembler mustn't stop it's execution under no circumstances, and creats all the necessary output files.
